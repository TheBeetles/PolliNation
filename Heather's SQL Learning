Database Management System (DBMS):
- special software program that helps users create and maintain a database
- is not the actual database; it is an application that creates, maintains, updates, deletes, secures/protects information from the actual dtaabase

C.R.U.D: core 4 operations we want the database management system to perform for us in the database
- Create (create information in the database, creating new database entries)
- Read/Retrieve (getting the stored information)
- Update (updating existing information)
- Delete (Deleting information in the database)

Two Types of Databases:

1. Relational Databases (SQL/Sequel)
- organizes data into one or more tables
    - each table has columns and rows
    - a unique key identifies each row

2. Non-Relational (noSQL/not just SQL)
- data is NOT organized in a traditional table
    - key-value stores
    - documents (JSON, XML, etc)
    - Graphs
    - Flexible tables
