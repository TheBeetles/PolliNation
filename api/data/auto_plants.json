It often grows in association with other drought-tolerant plants.",
        "future": " * **Conservation:**  As with many native plants, habitat loss due to development and land conversion is a major threat. Protecting existing populations and restoring degraded habitats are crucial for the long-term survival of this species. This includes responsible land management practices that minimize soil disturbance and protect its preferred habitats.  * **Fire Management:**  While fire can be a natural part of its ecosystem, frequent or intense fires can negatively impact *Eriogonum latifolium* populations.  Careful consideration of prescribed burning practices should be implemented, if at all, to ensure the survival of existing plants.  The timing and intensity of any burns need to be carefully managed.  * **Invasive Species Control:**  Controlling invasive plant species that outcompete *Eriogonum latifolium* for resources is essential.  This might involve manual removal, herbicide application (with careful consideration to avoid harming native plants), or other management techniques.  * **Restoration Efforts:**  In areas where *Eriogonum latifolium* populations have been lost or significantly reduced, restoration efforts can be undertaken. This might involve seeding or transplanting individuals, improving soil conditions, and controlling invasive species.  Success often depends on careful site selection and a thorough understanding of the species' ecological requirements.  * **Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of *Eriogonum latifolium* populations is needed to assess their health and identify any potential threats. This information can inform management decisions and help ensure the long-term conservation of the species.  This could include population counts, and assessment of factors affecting their health.   It is important to consult with local land managers and conservation organizations for specific management recommendations tailored to the particular location and context where *Eriogonum latifolium* occurs.

        "description": "** Camphorweed is an annual or short-lived perennial herbaceous plant.  It's easily recognized by its branching stems, which can grow anywhere from a few inches to over three feet tall. The leaves are typically lance-shaped to linear, with toothed or somewhat smooth edges.  They are alternately arranged along the stem and often covered with fine hairs.  The most striking feature is the abundant, small, yellow daisy-like flowers, usually appearing in clusters at the ends of the branches.  The flowers have ray florets (the outer \"petals\") surrounding a central disc of disc florets.  The plant has a strong, somewhat camphoraceous odor, hence its common name. The seeds are small and have a pappus (a tuft of hairs) aiding in wind dispersal.",
        "native": false,
        "living": "** Camphorweed is extremely adaptable and thrives in a wide range of disturbed habitats.  It's a common pioneer species, meaning it's often one of the first plants to colonize areas after disturbance. You'll find it frequently in:",
        "future": " * **Conservation:** In undisturbed natural areas, camphorweed contributes to biodiversity and provides habitat for insects and other wildlife.  In these cases, no management is typically necessary.  * **Weed control in cultivated areas:**  In agricultural settings or gardens, camphorweed can compete with crops or desirable plants.  Management strategies include: * **Mechanical control:**  Pulling or mowing can be effective, especially for young plants. Repeated mowing can weaken and eventually eliminate the plants, but it may also stimulate regrowth. * **Herbicide application:**  Several herbicides are effective against camphorweed, but the best choice will depend on the specific location and surrounding vegetation.  Always follow label instructions carefully.  Consider integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to minimize herbicide use. * **Prevention:**  Improving soil health and promoting the growth of desirable plants can help to prevent camphorweed establishment.  Proper grazing management can also help control its spread in pastures.  * **Restoration projects:** In some restoration efforts, camphorweed might be viewed as a temporary colonizer.  As the site recovers and more desirable species become established, camphorweed may naturally decline.  In summary, *Heterotheca subaxillaris* is a versatile species with a broad range of ecological roles.  Management decisions should be based on a careful assessment of the specific situation and desired outcomes.  Sustainable practices that minimize chemical interventions are often preferred. "
